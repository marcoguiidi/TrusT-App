## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up and run the application on your mobile device:

1.  **Install Dependencies:**
    Navigate to the root directory of the project in your terminal and run the following command to install all necessary dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2.  **Start the Expo Development Server:**
    Once the dependencies are installed, start the Expo development server. The `--clear` flag ensures a clean start.

    ```bash
    npx expo start --clear
    ```

3.  **Scan QR Code:**
    After executing the command above, a QR code will appear in your terminal. Use the [Expo Go app](https://expo.dev/client) on your mobile device (iOS or Android) to scan this QR code. The app will then load on your device.
